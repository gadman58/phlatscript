		<div class="intro">
		The PhlatScripT is a set of SketchUp tools that will allow for fold cuts and stepped angles for airplane control surfaces  not to mention a host of other cuts.  
		Check out the Phlatprinter picture gallery to see everything we would like it to do in the future.
		</div>
		<div class="intro">
		Since the PhlatScripT is released as open source, anyone and everyone is welcome to download it and change it and experiment with it.  
		All we ask in return is that you keep us updated with your progress and share your add on&rsquo;s with the rest of the world as open source.  
		The ultimate goal is to create a complete CAM solution directly within SketchUp capable of outputting 3D tool paths and possibly in the future will be the ability to not only output the g-code but control the Phlatprinter as well :)  
		I&rsquo;m sure the PhlatScripT will be adapted for many different types of machines.  
		This will be great.  Please share.
		</div>
		<div class="intro">
		The PhlatScripT can not be used for commercial gain or sold in any form.  
		We are keeping this truly open source.

				Tab Tool - 
				This tool is used to place tabs along any inside or outside Phlatboyz edge.
				The tabs hold the parts in place while the foam sheet moves back and forth in the machine.
				<br/><br/>
				This tool uses the tab width and tab depth factors which are defined in the Parameters dialog. 
				Use that dialog to define the tab tool parameters prior to using the tool; 
				changing the values in the Parameters dialog will not affect tabs that have already been placed.
				<br/><br/>
				When your design is completely cut out a hand tool will be needed to remove the parts that were held in by the tabs.
				<!--
				What you do in Artcam once you pick all of your inside/outside/fold edges is it asks you before you save to g-code if you want to tab your parts and you click yes and then you are able to click on the vector lines on the outside or inside vector lines, not the fold lines, and that instantly creates a little tab looking icon which basically looks like the vector line is broker with two half circles on either side of the broken point.  

				But anyway, getting back to the tabbing, it has predefined settings that you can set up for how wide you want your tabs and how deep you want your tabs.  
				The tabbing predefined setting should be .125 in length (how wide the tab is moving along the vector line) and .2 for the thickness (how far the cutter moves down).
				That creates a tab that holds your part in place that is approximately 1/8" wide by a little less than 1/4" deep and later they will cut that out with a razor knife to release their part.  
				Later when people build on the code, they can change the tabbing to whatever they want but our's will be just a small tab they can add wherever they want on the inside or outside cuts

				Fold Tool - 
				This tool is used to define a fold line on a currently defined SketchUp edge. 
				It will not work on any inside or outside cut Phlatboyz edges.
				<br/><br/>
				The fold tool has two modes. 
				The first mode will replace a single edge and shorten both sides of it by a fixed amount.
				The second mode (called the <i>wide</i> mode) will replace a complete edge.
				The &quot;w&quot; key is used to toggle between the two modes.
				<br/><br/>
				For either mode the tool is in, the depth of the fold cut is controlled by pressing the keyboard &quot;d&quot; key. 
				This allows toggling through 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% cut depth factors. 
				This factor will result in the cut depth as a percentage of the material thickness.
				You can see the current depth factor on the lower right hand side of the screen.
				If one of those values is not what you actually want, then just type the number directly using the keyboard.

				Plunge Tool - 
				This tool is used to create a plunge point at any given cursor position.
				<br/><br/>
				The plunge tool creates a circle with a radius line extending from the center to the outside diameter which is determined by the bit diameter setting in the parameters menu.
				<br/>
				The line color is Brown.  The diameter of the circle is whatever is currently set in the Phlatboyz &quot;Bit Diameter&quot; parameter.
				<br/>
				The plunge tool allows the generation of gcode required to plunge the bit at the depth indicated in the &quot;Material Thickness&quot; phlatboyz menu parameter.
